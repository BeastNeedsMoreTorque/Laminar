/** Event encapsulates a producer into which you can send events.
  *
  * This has two common usages:
  * - Receive events from [[EventPropOps]] when using `onClick --> eventBus` syntax
  * - Shared event stream that is populated from multiple sources which are otherwise
  *   hard or inefficient to compose into a single stream. For instance, when dealing
  *   with streams of lists this is a simpler and better performing alternative to
  *   [[com.raquo.laminar.collection.ReactiveCollection]]. See laminar-examples repo.
