    // - Receiver should add a subscription request into .subscriptionRequests
    // - in both createHook and prePatchHook we should check .subscriptionRequests
    //   - and actually create those subscriptions, and add them to .subscriptions, and remove the request
    // - then we can keep track of currentNode in here, which would make most of what's written below completely moot.
    // - the receiver would just need to provide a function that does the subscription
    // - before we start coding, what's the best way to store subscriptions?
    // @TODO ^^^ SEE ABOVE

    // Compare subscriptions on old node and new node
    // Unsubscribe from any old subscriptions that are not present on the new node

    // Receivers need to always have a fresh reference to currentNode.
    // This is not trivial because only the hooks of the newly patched node are called.
    // The hooks of the old node are not called when it is being patched.

    // Here's how we guarantee that currentNode is always fresh:

    // If the same Receiver modifier is applied to both old and new nodes independently,
    // those would be two different subscriptions (created in the modifier's applyTo method),
    // so we would unsubscribe from the old one here. So it wouldn't matter that its currentNode
    // reference would have gotten out of date.

    // On the other hand, if this hook is called because the node on which a subscription was applied
    // is being updated by some other Receiver on that node, then the new node will have the same
    // subscription as the prev node because we copy nodes including subscriptions when receivers
    // receive events. This means that the new node also has all the hooks of the old node, including
    // the one that updates currentNode in our subscription.

    // Lastly, if we're getting this event because the node is being patched by the very subscription
    // in question, the subscription has already updated its currentNode itself, and additionally the
    // part about copying from the previous paragraph applies as well.

    // So there is no way to patch a node while having currentNode in a subscription
    // on the previous node out of sync.

//    val maybeOldSubscriptions = oldVNode.data.subscriptions

//    maybeOldSubscriptions.foreach { oldSubscriptions =>
//      oldSubscriptions.attrs.get.get(attr.name).foreach { oldSubscription =>

//        if (newSubscriptions.isEmpty) {
//          dom.console.log(s"$commonPrefix: Unsubscribe old attr `${attr.name}` subscription because new subscriptions are not defined at all")
//          oldSubscription.unsubscribe()
